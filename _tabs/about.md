Hi - I'm Jeremy and welcome to my blog where I plan to document my journey from zero to hero in the ever-evolving realm of machine learning.

### Who Am I?

I'm not a machine learning guru or an expertâ€”far from it. I'm a simple hobbyest with a relentless curiosity and a determination to demystify the complexities of machine learning. This blog is my canvas, where I'll paint the story of my progress, the hurdles I face, and the victories I achieve as I navigate through algorithms, models, and the ever-expanding landscape of ML.

### What to Expect

This isn't just a blog; it's a documentation of the highs and lows of a learning journey. You can expect a blend of practical tutorials, candid reflections, and the occasional "aha" moments. From coding snippets to musings on the latest breakthroughs, I'll share it all as I strive to unravel the mysteries of machine learning.

To start this journey I will be following the AI Expert Roadmap created by [AMAI](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/)
1. Fundamentals
2. Data Scientist
3. Machine Learning
4. Deep Learning
